# ☼  The 'Say Thanks' Project

**NOTICE**: This project is in development, and your contributions are welcome!

## Spreading Thankfulness in Open Source™

***saythanks.io*** will provide a button/link for use by open source projects, to
encourage users to send a simple *thank you* note to the creator (or creators)
of that project. 

This simple button/link can be addded to READMEs and project documentation. 
The author can then enjoy a nice inbox (ideally) filled with very small, 
thoughtful messages from the happy users of the software they enjoy to 
toil over. 

## Implementation Concepts

### ☤ The Basics

- Email a when a new message of thankfulness is submitted (csrf enabled).
- Inbox page for each user/project with simple aggregation of messages (private).

### ☤ The Architecture

- Flask for API and Frontend, single application
- Auth0 for credential storage (in progress)
- Heroku for Hosting (done!)
- CloudFlare for SSL termination (done!)
- GitHub account creation, as well as passwordless email accounts

## Intended Collaborators
