# SayThanks.io: Thankfulness for Open Source

**NOTICE: This project is in development, and your contributions are welcome!**

***Say Thanks** will be a button/link for use by open source projects, to
encourage users to send a simple *thank you* note to the creator (or creators)
of that project.

## Implementation Concepts

### The Basics

- Email a when a new message of thankfulness is submitted (csrf enabled).
- Inbox page for each user/project with simple aggregation of messages (private).

### The Architecture

- Flask for API and Frontend, single application
- Auth0 for credential storage (in progress)
- Heroku for Hosting (done!)
- CloudFlare for SSL termination (done!)
- GitHub account creation, as well as passwordless email accounts
